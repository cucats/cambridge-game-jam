            <span> What is a game jam?</span>
        {/snippet}
        A game jam is an event where people collaborate to create games from scratch! It usually runs over
        a weekend and is a great way to learn new skills, meet new people, and have fun!

        {#snippet question()}
            <span>What are the game jam tracks?</span>
        {/snippet}
        All projects submit to a main track, which aligns with the overall theme of the event (to be
        revealed on the day). Participants can optionally submit the same project to one or more secondary
        tracks, whose themes extend the main theme in some way. Participants who opt into secondary tracks
        are eligible for both the main track and secondary track prizes.
